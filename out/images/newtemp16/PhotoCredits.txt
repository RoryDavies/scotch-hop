=================
A brute-force way of recording who took each pic, and what they're happy for us to do with it.
This file, and any similar, are likely to get out of date quickly,
as files are added/removed/renamed, but it's the best we can do.
In this file, the first field is the MD5 hash, as computed by md5sum (Unix) or MD5SUMS (Windows).

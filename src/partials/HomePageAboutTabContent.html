 <p>We are always on the lookout for anyone with an interest in Scottish dancing, 
to join us in improving Scotch Hop. 
If you've enjoyed an evening, and would like to help, please get in touch with us.
</p>

<p>Volunteers to help on the night are always useful. 
We organise a rota so that you don't need to help every night or all night
-
we need people at different times for different reasons, 
so you can do some of these and enjoy the evening of dance:
<p>
<ul>
<li>to arrive early to set up the venue (chairs, drinks, stage etc). </li>
<li>to help with the dances (demonstrating, counting lines, helping sets where needed).</li>
<li>to help with soft drinks and teas (particularly at the interval).</li>
<li>to clear up at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also need some people to form the committee, 
meeting several times through the year to plan the event
(dates, bands, venues, dance programmes, printing, publicity, grants, insurance, first aid etc etc).

<p>Since early 2016 (our 27th year), Linlithgow Scotch Hop has formally 
been a SCIO (Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation), 
regulated by OSCR (Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator). 
</p>

<p>This formalises how the committee do things, 
 and protects us as individuals acting in good faith.
</p>
      
<p>The details of our SCIO registration are :
 <BR>Full name:  Linlithgow Scotch Hop SCIO 
 <BR>Charity number SCO46165
</p>
      
 <p>You can find more details of what this means at the 
 <a href="http://www.oscr.org.uk/charities/becoming-a-charity/scio">OSCR website</a>
 </p>

 <p>Our SCIO status means that our list of Charity Trustees is available on request.</p>

  <div class="panel-body">  <!-- BS -->

<p>Linlithgow Scotch Hop was first organised, and compered, in 1981(?) by John Carswell.
Over the years a committee formed to help John with the increasing workload 
of organising the event, and running it each night.
Some of the main contributors in those years were ......
</p>

<p>In 2014, a largely fresh committee was formed to organise the event, with John helping with advice.
A further set of volunteers old and new helped each night.
</p>
<p>For the 2016 season, the committee decided to convert into a SCIO,
a type of organisation which had only recently been formalised in law.
This was intended to make no difference to the way Scotch Hop runs each year,
 but formalised how the committee did some things, 
 and protected them as individuals acting in good faith.
Most of the previous Committee became Charity Trustees of the SCIO.

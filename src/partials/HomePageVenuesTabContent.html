<p>Whenever possible, we will dance in the Palace. 
However, as an open-air venue, there will be times when the weather will not be suitable.
On these occasions we will dance indoors at the Low Port, 
for the sake of the band as well as the dancers and spectators.
</p
<p>
			A decision is made as late as possible (up to 6.00pm) 
      and will be posted on twitter (see the Latest tab).
      We will also have people or signs at the Palace directing you to the Low Port.

<h3>Seating</h3>
<p> There is limited availability of seating.
Like the dancing, it is outdoors, 
and it can get chilly despite the shelter provided by the Palace walls. 
So we recommend warm clothing or a blanket, 
especially if you may be watching more than dancing.
</p>      

<h3>Wheelchair access</h3>
<p>There is a ramp at the entrance, and some parts of the surface are uneven, 
but it is generally accessible to wheelchairs.
Some space is reserved for wheelchairs.</p>        

<h3>Toilets</h3> 
<p>There is one toilet in the Palace, reserved for the disabled. This cannot be used during tea breaks.</p>
<p>There are ample toilets in the Burgh Halls in the Kirkgate on the approach to the Palace.</p>

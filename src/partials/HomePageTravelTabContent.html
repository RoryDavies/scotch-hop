<p>Yes, some people do arrive this way!</p>
<p>
The canal offers a fairly flat route, from Edinburgh or Falkirk.
Leave the canal at the Canal Centre, ride towards the railway station but do not enter it.
Instead continue down the hill then left under the railway.
At the roundabout go left (to the Palace) or right (to the Low Port).

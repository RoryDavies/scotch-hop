      <p><b>Linlithgow Palace</b> (EH49 7AL) is in the town centre. 
      <b>Low Port Centre</b> (EH49 7HZ) is on Blackness Road on the east side of the town, opposite Tesco.      
      </p>            
 
 <h2>by Road</h2>     
 <p>From Edinburgh or the East - M9 Junction 3.
 From Falkirk / Stirling - M9 Junction 4.
 From Glasgow - M8 to Junction 2 then M9 to Junction 3. 
 Then follow A803 towards the town centre.
</p> 
<p>      There is limited parking at the Palace itself, with some spaces reserved for Blue Badge holders.
      There is also plenty of parking a short walk away - please consider using this.
      At the Low Port itself, parking is also limited, but there is a large car park over the road near Tesco.
</p>

 <h2>by Rail</h2> 
 <p>Linlithgow is on the Edinburgh-Glasgow railway line. The station is about 0.5km from either venue.
 If coming from Glasgow, leave the station down onto the High Street.
 If coming from Edinburgh, enter the shelter and use the pedestrian tunnel under the railway then leave for the High Street.
 </p>
 <p>Once on the High Street, for the Palace, go left, after 200m (at the Square) turn right up to the Palace.
 Or for the Low Port, go right, then at the mini-roundabout, go left. 
 Low Port is on the left at the pedestrian crossing.

<h2>by Bike</h2>

<p>Yes, some people do arrive this way!</p>
<p>
The canal offers a fairly flat route, from Edinburgh or Falkirk.
Leave the canal at the Canal Centre, ride towards the railway station but do not enter it.
Instead continue down the hill then left under the railway.
At the roundabout go left (to the Palace) or right (to the Low Port).
